                <p>I have frequented this website as both a reader and editor, 
                    and have found the interface to be unintuitive on both fronts. 
                    I love The Indy and hope to better highlight the high quality work the paper produces. </p>

            <div class = "usability-issues">
                <p>i made observations about the usability in a few distinct categories:</p>
                <table style="width: 100%">
                    <tr>
                      <th>Usability </th>
                      <th>Efficiency</th>
                      <th>Learnability</th>
                      <th>Memorability</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td> The ability to navigate by “section” is hidden by a dropdown menu</td>
                        <td>There is no simple table of contents: in order to see all of the issue, one must scroll through the entire site</td>
                      <td> It is slightly difficult to understand how particular parts of the box bring people to an article </td>
                      <td>There is no way to store individual articles or bookmark to read later would could be a useful tool </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>It is also difficult to distinguish what is being clicked on because the individual sections do not have buttons</td>
                      <td>There is redundancy in the dropdown menu </td>
                      <td>Some links (apply, subscribe, alumni, donate) are dead </td>
                      <td>While navigation is standardized, there is no way to really return to where the user last came from </td>
                    </tr>
        
                  </table>
                  </div>
                  <div class = "accessibility">
                    <p> using WebAIM WAVE, I found the following accessibility issues: </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>
                            Redundant links: when clicking on an article, the whole box and text itself links to new pages 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Empty links: some of the links don’t go anywhere 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The all white background and boxes make it slightly difficult to distinguish the articles from the webpage 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I agree with the accessibility problems; a lot of the website has unintuitive linking and while that is frustrating as a user, 
                        I understand that can also pose accessibility issues for those relying on particular means of moving through the multiple pages. </p>

                        <td> She is very familiar with the interface and does not think about it visually at all, and instead interacts based on instinct (automatically start scanning, presses buttons, then taps to pay)</td>

                        <td>While the interface is relatively simple, he acknowledges that the various shades of blue + unhelpful images may impair the accessibility of this interface                         </td>

                <p> key takeaways: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While this interface is not very different from most self check out options, it did seem that it rewarded people who already understood its rhythm </li>
                    <li>Most users seem to value effiency, as they come to this CVS for quick errands often</li>
                    <li>Most people seemed to ignore the voiceover / did not wait for its verbal instructions </li>
                    <li>Because it was somewhat crowded, there seemed to be a general sense of annoyance at the line and perhaps interface, as it does not reward speed </li>
                </ul>
            <div id = "arrow">

            <div class = "personas">
                <p> from these observations, i created two personas that embody most users' needs:</p>
                <div id = "personas-compared">
                    <img src = "personas-compared.jpg" width = 700px height = auto >
                </div>
                <br>
                <div id = "personas-charts">
                    <img src = "persona-1.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                    <img src = "persona-2.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                </div>
                <p> with this persona, harry, i created a storyboard which encapsulates the user experience of this interface: </p>
                <div id = "storyboard" >
                    <img src = "storyboard-1.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                    <img src = "storyboard-2.jpg" width = 500px height = auto >
                </div>
                <p> thank you for reading my storyboard! i hope you understand this interface a little bit better :) </p>
