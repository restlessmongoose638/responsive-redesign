                    <h2>Gleaning as a Practice in Combating Food Insecurity in RI</h2>
                    <p>By Mark Buckley</p>
                    <p>The term “food desert” is used by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to measure 
                        food insecurity. A “food desert” describes low-income areas in which households 
                        are more than a mile away from large-scale grocery stores. 
                        In Rhode Island, 91% of low-income areas qualify as deserts, the highest in the nation. 
                        Yet many take issue with this phrase, arguing that it does not implicate 
                        the policy and market decisions which produce this phenomenon. </p>
                        <p> Food justice activists have proposed the phrase “food apartheid” 
                            to better capture the true causes and complexities of food insecurity. 
                            Eva Agudelo, who has a decade of experience with food non-profits, 
                            is an advocate for this adjustment in terminology.  </p>

                    <h2>From the Editors</h2>
                    <p> Brandish your board like a just-cleaned broadsword; you’ve been carrying it all day 
                        for this moment. Start at Smitty B, beyond that quaint garden with the bench and the 
                        plants and the squirrels. Look for cars—or not, no one lives forever—and then you’re 
                        off! To your right, the parking lot! To your left, the house with the vegans! 
                        Make sure to glance daringly down the Meeting Street mountain. Then, a few seconds 
                        later, sneak a peek at that department building they just moved somehow (how’d 
                        they do that?). Pretty soon you’ll be coasting under the arch and down the
                         green—prepare yourself to slide through the oncoming narrow gateway, 
                         before bursting out onto the open road, hell yeah! (Watch out for cars!) 
                         Keep going until Power (that’s Brown to Power, not Power to Brown—never the latter) 
                         and then bang a sharp left. Smile at an onlooker and give your trusty board another 
                         pump; you’re almost home. -SS</p>

                    <p>By Anushka Kataruka</p>
                    <p>“Everywhere I travel, I see the same story,” Hamid Mir, a GeoTV Pakistani journalist, says in a recent news broadcast. 
                        “I was here during [the] 2010 [floods], when aid was still successfully reaching people … but 
                        now reaching people has been impossible for NGOs, 
                        governments, and the media.” </p>
                        <p> Mir stands against a backdrop of makeshift tents, next to what seems like a 
                            boundless lake—but in fact it is land that has been completely submerged by the catastrophic
                            floods in Sindh, Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>Apple TV’s Severance opens on a bird's-eye shot of a disoriented Helly R. (Britt Lower) 
                            lying facedown on a conference table. An unknown voice comes through the room’s speaker, 
                            asking, “Who are you?” The voice is cool, slightly upbeat, verging on automated. </p>
                        <p>
                            Helly looks around and scoffs: “That’s the first question?” Then she goes silent. 
                            She can’t answer it. This realization is as unsettling for us as viewers as it is for Helly. </p>

                <p>Extry extry, read all about it! Nora and I have a nose for news, but nothing really 
                    happened this week so we decided to make some headlines of our own by performing 
                    random acts of kindness around our community. At first, we wanted it to be anonymous, 
                    but then we realized we could extract social capital from telling people about it! 
                    So here’s a list of all the kindnesses we did, take notes <333</p>

                <p>Every object is embedded in a socio-historical matrix that points toward the future. 
                    Technologies’ fraying threads—discourses, materials, fantasies—contain and gesture at potentialities. 
                    Here, I present a possible critical framework for three art pieces, and follow it by constructing 
                    a world knotted together with some of the threads within and around these objects.

                <p>By Sarah McGrath</p>
                <p>On September 15, 2022, TikTok announced the creation of “TikTok Now”—
                    a new feature on the app’s homepage that will prompt users to post a 
                    ‘candid’ photo of themselves at a different moment every day. 
                    According to a statement released by the company, this not-so-thinly 
                    veiled attempt to replicate the popular photo-sharing app “BeReal” was 
                    designed to “bring the authenticity of TikTok to a whole new creative 
                    experience.” </p>
